Our journey started in 2020 when we noticed that your Discord community contains a lot of valuable messages, channels, and members that you wouldn't want to lose if you got hacked or deleted. This is when we set out to make VaultCord.

VaultCord uses official Discord APIs to backup messages, automod rules, stickers, forum threads and more. We also provide a feature for pulling back Discord members and checking these members for alt-account & other security checks. Transform your Discord server a safe space with VaultCord.
